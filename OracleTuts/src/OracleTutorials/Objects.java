		/*Objects in Java, like objects in the real world, have states in behaviors. When you think of a state, for example, you can think of
		your dog. Your dog can be small, or large, or medium sized. It can be awake or sleeping, or it can be hungry or not hungry. In java 
		these states are called variables. To stay with the dog example, your animal can also have behaviors - it can be eating or not eating,
		barking or not barking, sleeping or awake. In java these are called methods. 
		
		Methods in java act on an objects state and change them. When your variables are 'private' and can only be accessed through methods,
		this adds security to your program. Accessing and changing a java programs states through use of methods is called encapsulation,
		and it is one of the most important concepts in the java language.*/
